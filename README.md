## Talent Finder App
Landing page Implementation of a Talent Finding App Concept by Joseph Kalu [https://twitter.com/thejosephKalu] using HTML/CSS/JS/JQuery and PHP. 
The challenge was to utilize a new backend language for form handling and use a SQL database, so I went with the well-documented PHP and MySQL.
I had three days to complete this challenge for submission.
This was a task on the HNG Internship 7.
